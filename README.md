# Cardcounter

Welcome to cardcounter, a ruby gem to practice counting cards via the command line.  The gem allows you to choose how many decks to use, and how long to practice for.  There is also a 'boss' feature at the end to print out some git nonsense and makes it look like you are doing work.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cardcounter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cardcounter

## Usage

Cardcounter is a command line tool, anytime that you have an open terminal just type cardcounter to begin

	$ cardcounter

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
